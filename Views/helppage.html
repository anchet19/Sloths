          This software handles the process of scheduling time slots
          automatically so the administrator does not need to do it by hand.

        <li class="question">
          What happens if I request a time slot at the same time as another
          employee?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          No problem! When the administrator finalizes the schedule, our
          fairness algorithm calculates which employee gets the time slot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="response">
        <li class="question">
          I did not get the time slot I requested and it was given to another
          employee (or employees) that also requested it. Is there a "secret" to
          always get a slot?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Not precisely. We try to make it as fair as possible for all
          employees. Don't worry, if you did not get a slot you requested, this
          may increase your chance to win a timeslot next time.
