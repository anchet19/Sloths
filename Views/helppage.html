        <li class="question">What is the purpose of this software?</li>
        <li class="answer">
          This software handles the process of scheduling time slots
          automatically so the administrator does not need to do it by hand.

        <li class="question">
          What happens if I request a time slot at the time time as another
          employee?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          No problem! When the administrator finalizes the schedule, our
          fairness algorithm calculates which employee gets the time slot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="response">
        <li class="question">
          I did not get the time slot I requested and it was given to another
          employee (or employees) that also requested it. Is there a "secret" to
          always get a slot?
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Not precisely. We try to make it as fair as possible for all
          employees. Every user has a "score" that changes depending on that
          respective user's choices when selecting time slots. This score is
          used as a "tiebreaker" when multiple users request a time slot. Don't
          worry, if you did not get a slot you requested, this increases your
          chance to win a tiebreaker next time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="response">
        <li class="question">What version is this software?</li>
        <li class="answer">
          At the time this software is presented to ASRC Federal in December,
          the software is at version 1.0.
